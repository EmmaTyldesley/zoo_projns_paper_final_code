This MATLAB code loops over the CPR samples and matches in space and time with predictors from the Copernicus Marine NW European Shelf (AMM7 domain) phys-bgc reanalysis 1993-2022.

Data from that reanalysis model is not hosted here but can be downloaded from the Copernicus Marine Data Store (https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/products) products NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_PHY_004_009 and NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_BGC_004_011.

Main script: match_cpr_and_amm7_predictors.m

Help scripts: annual_SST_anomaly.m, bloom_phenology.m, nitrate.m - get annual and monthly SST, phytoplankton and nitrate variables from AMM7 reanalysis

Inputs: cpr_add.mat (MATLAB struct version of CPR data), annual_AMM7_SST_1993_2022.mat, monthly_AMM7_SST_anomaly_1993_2022.mat, bloom_1998_2022.mat, amm7_monthly_nitrate_1993_2023.mat (generated by help scripts)

Outputs: zed_and_amm7.txt
